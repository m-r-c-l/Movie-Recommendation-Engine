tensorflow-macos==2.15.0; sys_platform == 'darwin' and 'ARM' in platform_version # Mac M-chips
tensorflow==2.15.0; sys_platform == 'darwin' and 'ARM' not in platform_version # Mac Intel chips
tensorflow==2.15.0; sys_platform != 'darwin' # Windows & Ubuntu Intel chipsÂ´

# Ensuring no versioning conflicts with tensorflow==2.15.0 which is the last stable version for tensorflow-recommenders
